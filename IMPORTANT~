	PENCIL BENCHMARKING VER 0.1

	- To Run benchmarking codes, make sure include path is set properly. 
	- It should point to all standard C libraries along with all PENCIL header files.
	- You can view default include path by using INCLUDE_DIRS option for pencilcc.
	- Commands to run benchmarks :
		pencilcc <INCLUDE PATH IF REQD> FILENAME/S ../utilities/include/pencilbench.c -o outfile	

	- Please use the provided template for writing benchmarks. You can find it at ./utilities

	- SIDENOTE : PENCIL region must be annotated as shown below. (And not by using #pragma pencil{...} region)
	
	
					      
						      #pragma scop 
						      {
							....
						      }
						      #pragma endscop	


	- It is also nice idea to compare sequential/ parallel execution. 	

	- Sample output for gemm benchmark :looks like

		$./test 

 		Problem Size : 
 		RowA = 2500, ColA = 2500, ColB : 2500
 		Kernel Start
 		kernel end
 		Execution time :10.814283
